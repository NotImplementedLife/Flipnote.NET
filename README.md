# Flipnote<span>.NET</span>
## *(Some people may know it as FlipnoteDesktop)*

Enjoy pure nostalgia of the DSi times with a fan-made PC version of  Flipnote Studio.

# Overview
Flipnote<span>.NET</span> is a Windows app used to create and view Flipnotes. It packs the original Flipnote Studio features and many other tools which make use of the processing power of a PC into an easy to use interface.

## Includes:

- some basic frame/layers operations (paper, colors, frame addition/multiplication/deletion)
- a grid
- 4 tools (pen, brush, eraser, line)
- a properties menu
- animation preview feature
- an immature plugin framework (could be used for automated frame generation)

## Bugs/Limitations

- numeric inputs cannot be edited using keys, but only by pressing the right-side provided arrows
- Plugin Manager window is empty for the time being
- possibility to crash (not tested yet)
- the number of frames is not restricted in the app (altough Nintendo cannot play flipnotes with frame count over 999 or something like that)
- need to redraw the logo

## To Do

- add more tools
- improve the preview window
- update the plugin manager and create some plugins
- add frame diffing and frame translation to the save options
- rewrite everything using [PPMLib](https://github.com/miso-xyz/PPMLib "PPMLib")

# Requirements

- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6
