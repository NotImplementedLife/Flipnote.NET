# Version 1.0.40.51026

- a small Christmas gift for y'all

## This version includes:

- some basic frame/layers operations (paper, colors, frame addition/multiplication/deletion)
- a grid
- 4 tools (pen, brush, eraser, line)
- a properties menu
- animation preview feature
- an immature plugin framework (could be used for automated frame generation)

## Bugs/Limitations

- numeric inputs cannot be edited using keys, but only by pressing the right-side provided arrows
- Plugin Manager window is empty for the time being
- possibility to crash (not tested yet)
- the number of frames is not restricted in the app (altough Nintendo cannot play flipnotes with frame count over 999 or something like that)
- need to redraw the logo

## To Do

- add more tools
- improve the preview window
- update the plugin manager and create some plugins
- add frame diffing and frame translation to the save options

# Requirements

- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6

# Credit

- guys from DSiBrew and Flipnote Collective for their awesome documentation on .PPM file format.
- some of the icons were made using a PNG to SVG converter
